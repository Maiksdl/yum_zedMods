This Git will be the home for my dayz projects, I am going to migrate from pastebin.


Specifically for my dayz zed changes, there will be two sections - mission and addon

Mission = new spawning script, permanent loot and zeds, rewritten ai, speed very slow or normal fast or faster

Addon = new zed animations, taken from Undead Mod, allows completely customizable speeds (medium pace!) 
& adding new player skins
download addon folder like any other. warning, skins one is not working. 

everything coming soon, do not use code at this time if you are not comfortable with troubleshooting!
