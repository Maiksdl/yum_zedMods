VERY pre-release quality ---mmmyum's zed mods for dayz

>>>
	This is not a release for the inexperienced.
>>>

This Git will be the home for my dayz projects, I am going to migrate from pastebin.  First, thanks to everyone who's code I've learned from! Thanks to other arma modders, like the undead mod and dayz epoch! thanks the most to opendayz!!!



Here you will find three categories:

MISSION_SERVER = new spawning script, permanent loot and zeds, rewritten ai, speed very slow or normal fast or faster, as well as any other mission fixes/edited dayz code

ADDONS = clientside mod for zed animations and speed, clientside/serverside mod for additional player skins - RAW_CODE is the unpacked data

MYSCRIPTS = home for my airraid script and a few other snippets I've found useful



Now, these changes are hardly ready for public consumption - and are not noob friendly.   The addons can be run like any other addon, for skins and zed animations. 
		However, the changes I've made to zeds regarding spawning/number of zeds/loot generation/zed AI and more - all very very alpha.  Still working out the kinks.  
	In any case, the code is working well for me, if you are interested, please add me on steam (mmmyum) and I will invite you to the server.
