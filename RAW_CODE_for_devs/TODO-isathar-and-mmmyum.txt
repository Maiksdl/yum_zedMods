- player_spawnCheck rewrite based on nearlocation (city, town, village, single, etc) randomly filling the area 
      - this way we don't have to rely on nearest buildings
  - deal with zed spawn in lag

- zombie_agent.fsm rewrite for more efficiency, sleep phase, deal with despawn lag
  - shorten retarget reaction timer - so zeds retarget very quickly

- try other animations

- zed retargeting and passing on to newly targeted player (secondhand zombie stuff?)

- get noob friendly code ready for release 
    - permanent zed/loot spawning and 
    - changed max zed numbers
    - maybe slow zed AI fix
    - our animation addon


- test newest addon for player skins
